# My Portfolio Website
This project showcases my web development skills through a portfolio built with HTML and CSS. Check it out live here: [My Portfolio]([http://recruiters-love-seeing-live-demos.com/](https://tusharpatowary.netlify.app/))!



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This website is a simple yet elegant demonstration of my frontend development capabilities. I used semantic HTML to structure the content, ensuring accessibility and SEO best practices. For styling, I leveraged modern CSS features like flexbox and grid for a responsive layout. I also incorporated CSS transitions to add smooth visual effects for an interactive user experience. Every part of the website is custom-built from scratch to reflect my design aesthetics and attention to detail.

## Optimizations

During the development process, I focused on performance. By optimizing images, minifying CSS, and using browser caching, I ensured faster load times. I also refactored my CSS for better maintainability and reduced redundancy, making the stylesheets lighter and more efficient.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this portfolio helped reinforce the importance of responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and clean code structure. I also learned how crucial attention to detail is when translating a design into a functional and visually appealing website. This project pushed me to think creatively about layouts and improved my understanding of CSS best practices.
